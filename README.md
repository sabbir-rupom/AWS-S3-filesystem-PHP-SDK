// Execute upload function
$uploadResutl = $awsSdkObj->uploadFileToS3('s3-bucket-name', 'file-name', 'file-source-in-server-local', 'content-type-mime');

// Check file upload result
if (empty($uploadResutl)) {
    die('Failed to upload file in S3 Storage!');
} elseif (false == $uploadResutl['success']) {
    die('Failed to upload file in S3 Storage! ' . $uploadResutl['msg']);
